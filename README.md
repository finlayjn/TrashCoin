# TrashCoin
TrashCoin Hackathon Final Project

TrashCoin is a scavenger hunt-style game that incentivizes youth to pick up trash and litter by gamifying the process. The app displays user reported problem areas, where users can find exponential amounts of trash to clean up. Users then take pictures of themselves cleaning up trash in exchange for TrashCoin, a cryptocurrency.
